# nihaisha

**Turn Ni Haisha's Traditional Chinese Medicine course materials into a searchable, traceable Agent Skill with clear safety boundaries.**

A Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw Skill. Once installed in an agent, it lets you use natural language to search Ni Haisha course materials by symptom, formula, acupoint, course module, lesson, or board/PPT screenshot, then returns study-oriented pattern analysis, formula/acupoint/herb comparisons, lesson review plans, and screenshot evidence indexes.

## Course Distillation Method

The course distillation method used in this project comes from the author's [lineage-skill](https://github.com/JuneYaooo/lineage-skill), which turns dense course materials into traceable, reusable Agent Skills.

## Update Log

### 2026-06-25

- Based on course proofreading materials organized by Qihuang Shengxian Zhihui, this update corrects a set of terminology, formula-name, acupoint-name, and classical-citation errors that came from earlier video/audio transcription.
- Added page-level PDF evidence under [`references/pdf-evidence/`](../references/pdf-evidence/) so course-text corrections can be traced by source, page, and keyword.
- Added a classical-source, formula-pattern, and terminology index entry at [`references/ebooks.md`](../references/ebooks.md) for checking classical references mentioned in the courses.
- Term indexes are split by module, including Shang Han Lun, Jingui, Zhongjing Xinfa, acupuncture, Huangdi Neijing, and Shennong Bencao, so learners can search by topic.

## What it does

- **Plain-language entry point**: turns everyday descriptions such as "cold with chills", "cold hands and feet", "diarrhea", or "cannot sleep" into the differentiating questions used in the courses.
- **Multi-course retrieval**: covers Shang Han Lun, Jingui Yaolue, Zhongjing Xinfa, clinical cases, Bagang pattern identification, Fuyang Forum, Yijinjing, the Liang Dong interview, Stanford lecture, Tianji, Huangdi Neijing, Shennong Bencao, acupuncture courses, plus course handouts, study notes, and audio collection mappings.
- **Six-channel and formula-pattern navigation**: organizes the core Shang Han Lun material by six-channel patterns, symptoms, formulas, and disease-transmission logic.
- **Acupoint and herb study**: searches acupuncture channels and points, point-combination ideas, and Shennong Bencao course material on herb properties, dosage forms, compatibility, and single-herb clues.
- **Lesson-by-lesson review**: builds topic maps, keywords, and review questions by course module and lesson.
- **Screenshot evidence**: includes 2,986 screenshot evidence entries, with compressed WebP images stored in the repo. Search by formula name, acupoint, lesson, pathomechanism, Tianji keyword, or timestamp.
- **PDF source evidence**: includes 11 text-extractable PDF sources, 3,003 page-level evidence cards, and 6 module term indexes for checking course terminology, classical citations, and formula-pattern clues.
- **Safety boundary**: defaults to course study and TCM theory organization. It does not provide personal diagnosis, prescriptions, or dosage guidance.

## Safety notice

This project is only for studying Ni Haisha's courses, retrieving course material, and organizing Traditional Chinese Medicine theory. It is not for medical diagnosis, individualized treatment, prescribing formulas, purchasing herbs, dosage decisions, or self-medication. Chinese herbal medicine and classical formulas require careful judgment about pattern identification, dosage, processing, contraindications, constitution, disease stage, and medication interactions. Misuse can create serious health risks.

For topics involving Fuzi-class herbs, Sini Tang-family formulas, Da Chengqi Tang / urgent purging to preserve yin, Didang Tang, Da Xianxiong Tang, cancer/tumors, pregnancy, children, chest pain, altered consciousness, severe dehydration, or other urgent or severe conditions, consult a qualified physician or emergency service immediately.

See [`USE_AND_RISK_NOTICE.md`](./USE_AND_RISK_NOTICE.md) for the full usage, risk, and non-commercial-use boundaries.

## Copyright and usage notice

## Origin

This project began as a family learning need. My father has recently been studying Ni Haisha's courses and wanted an easier way to search, review, and follow the course structure. I grew up with Chinese herbal medicine and have long had trust in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since my background is computer science, and I had recently practiced course distillation methods in other domains with good results, I wanted to distill a Ni Haisha learning skill first for my father's study.

I open-sourced it in the hope that it can also help others who are studying Ni Haisha's courses, Chinese medical classics, and classical formula systems. The project is intended for deep study, source lookup, citation checking, and knowledge organization, not for diagnosis or prescription advice. For real health issues, consult a qualified clinician offline and avoid creating health risks by copying formulas, purchasing herbs, or adjusting dosages on your own.

## Acknowledgements and community

First, thanks to Master Ni Haisha for leaving behind a large body of Chinese medicine course teaching. His courses connect Shang Han Lun, Jingui, acupuncture, materia medica, Huangdi Neijing, Tianji, and clinical pattern thinking into a course system that learners can study, verify, and review by lesson, topic, and question. This project only organizes those materials for learning; its value starts from Master Ni's teaching and transmission.

Thanks also to Master Ni's students, fans, learners, and volunteers who have spent years transcribing, proofreading, organizing, and sharing course materials, subtitles, handouts, screenshots, and study notes. Without that long-running community effort, this project could not build further structured distillation, indexing, and correction on top of the course corpus.

Special thanks to Dr. Deyi Liu (Dee Liu) of Suzhou Yunzhengtang and members of the Qihuang Shengxian Zhihui group for supporting course-text proofreading and classical-source collation. The proofreading PDFs and related classical/formula reference materials used in this update were provided by Dr. Deyi Liu (Dee Liu). Many terminology corrections in earlier video/audio transcriptions were also made after Dr. Deyi Liu (Dee Liu) pointed out likely transcription errors. This support made the current page-level, source-traceable evidence layer possible.

Thanks to the [Datawhale community](https://github.com/datawhalechina) and [LINUX DO - Chinese Developer Community](https://linux.do/) for their long-running support of open learning, technical exchange, and collaborative knowledge building. This project shares the same open and mutual-help spirit and is for learning and exchange only.

TCM clinicians, students, and enthusiasts are welcome to help maintain this project. Corrections and additions are especially valuable for terminology errors in transcriptions, formula/acupoint/herb name corrections, classical-source checks, missing screenshot or PDF evidence, incomplete sections, and inaccurate wording. Contributions can come through issues, pull requests, or community feedback. All collaboration remains limited to course study, material lookup, and source verification; it does not provide personal diagnosis, prescriptions, dosage, or self-medication advice.
