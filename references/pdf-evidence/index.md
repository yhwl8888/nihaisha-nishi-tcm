# PDF Evidence Index

This directory contains public-safe distilled evidence extracted from the Nihaisha PDF source set. It is intended for source-grounded correction and citation inside the skill references.

## Citation Format

- Use `pdf-evidence:<doc_id>#p<page>` for page-level citations.
- Resolve `<doc_id>` in `source-manifest.json` or `sources.md`.
- Use `evidence-cards.jsonl` for the short page excerpt and detected terms.
- Use `python scripts/search_pdf_evidence.py <term...>` or `rg` to search `evidence-cards.jsonl` / `term-index/<module>.json`; avoid opening module JSON indexes wholesale.

Example: `pdf-evidence:6d7e12d9f0ab#p52` means page 52 of the PDF whose `doc_id` is `6d7e12d9f0ab`.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sources.md` | Human-readable public-safe PDF source list. |
| `source-manifest.json` | Machine-readable PDF source manifest. |
| `evidence-cards.jsonl` | One short evidence card per text-extractable PDF page. |
| `term-index/index.json` | Module index manifest for term lookup files. |
| `term-index/<module>.json` | Module-scoped term-to-card lookup with short snippets. |
| `modules/*.md` | Module-level source summaries and representative evidence cards. |
| `correction-decisions.md` | High-confidence corrections and evidence status notes. |

## Evidence Policy

- These files use stable document IDs rather than machine-specific paths.
- PDF pages with no extractable text are not represented here; use OCR/MinerU later for image-only pages.
- Short excerpts are for verification, not a replacement for the source PDFs.
- Repeated source watermarks are stripped from evidence card excerpts; the original PDF source may contain the watermark `学习资料成本价打印公益流通禁止加价贩卖 微信公众号:岐黄圣贤智慧、岐黄传承道法自然`.
- Course-derived medical content remains educational and is not individualized medical advice.

## Coverage

- PDF sources with extractable text: 11
- Evidence cards: 3003
